## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to create a low-stakes game of concentration that's both enjoyable and adorable. As someone who's more interested in relaxing than stress-inducing games, I blended together my love of minimalist design and cats with some JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
### User Goals
Targeted users of this game:
- are more interested in a soothing than challenging game.
- appreciate cats and minimalist aesthetics. 
### User Stories
As a user of this site, I expect: 
- easy-to-understand instructions.
- straightforward, intuitive organization of elements, including the game board and navigation buttons/links.
- responsive design to fit my different screen sizes.
- visual feedback when selecting game pieces and buttons.
### Site Owner Goals
- Create an enjoyable, calming, aesthetically-pleasing game.
- Receive feedback from users through contact form. 

## User Expectations and Requirements 
Expectations | Requirements
------------ | -------------
Play instructions are thorough and understandable | Write and present instructions coherently
Game maintains user interest | Include elements that offer visual feedback upon interaction
Contact Form works properly | Contact Form validation allows user contact yet limits spam
Content is appealing and useful | Design is thoughtful and tested on various devices before deployment
Game sticks with purpose of being low-stakes yet enjoyable | Difficulty level can be chosen by users
## Design Choices
Like many other folks, being stuck inside more has brought me to experiment with makeup. Tied to that experimentation is visiting various brand's sites and soaking up their design. [Glossier](https://www.https://www.glossier.com/), an American-based beauty brand, is well-known for their reliance on heavy white space with baby pink and black accents. The effect is a striking, easy-to-navigate site and has heavily influenced these design choices.

### Fonts
Keeping to a minimalist design, this site uses varying weights of a single font rather than multiple fonts to differentiate headings, links, and text. [Work Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) was chosen because it is a clean, variable font. 
### Icons
Standard icons from Bootstrap's Icon [Library](https://www.icons.getbootstrap.com/) will be used to direct users to navigate both the site and game. As the site uses the Bootstrap framework for layout purposes, the intigration of the icon library made sense. 
### Colors
ADD MEOWMORY PALETTE 
- **Default Background Color** #F9DCE0 This Pale Pink gives the site a mellow, soft feel that will allow the other colors to peep out. 
- **Accent Color** #FFC4D6 This Orchid Pink will be used in element outlines. 
- **Interactive Element Color** #FFA6C1 Carnation Pink will be used as the background color on clickable, interactive elements.
- **Font and Icon color** #000 To round out the soft pinks, Black will be used on icons and text.
